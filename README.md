# Emotion Recognition from Images

This project focuses on training a machine learning model to recognize emotions (happy, sad, neutral) from images. The model is trained on a large dataset containing images representing different emotions. Two approaches are explored: training with data augmentation and training without data augmentation, to compare model performance.

## Overview

Understanding human emotions from images is a challenging yet crucial task with various applications in human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and affective computing. This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of recognizing emotions from images, providing insights into human emotional states.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection:** Gathered a large dataset of images representing different emotions, including happy, sad, and neutral expressions.

- **Data Augmentation:** Applied data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training data and improve model generalization.

- **Model Training:** Trained a machine learning model using TensorFlow, utilizing both augmented and unaugmented datasets.

- **Evaluation:** Evaluated the model's performance on a separate test set to assess its accuracy and effectiveness in emotion recognition.
